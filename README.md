## ⚠️ Important Notes on Updating
1. **Patience is key!** 🕒  
   When you push updates to the repository, **GitHub Actions** may imply that the site is ready immediately. However, GitHub Pages often takes a bit longer to reflect changes.  

2. **Avoid Rapid Updates!**  
   Making too many changes in a short time can cause confusion or missed updates. Always wait for the site to fully swap to the latest changes before making additional updates.
